# Wireless Sensor Network routing using Ant Colony Optimization

Wireless Sensor Networks comprised of nodes with little power are deployed to collect valuable field data. It is essential for WSNs to gather data in an energy-efficient way. Ant Colony Optimization, an optimization approach based on swarm intelligence, is frequently utilized in network routing. For Wireless Sensor Networks comprised of stable nodes, a new routing strategy using an Ant Colony Optimization method is presented.
